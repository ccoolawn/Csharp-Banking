QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS:

In Cheking and Savings classes, if you defined values for minBalance and interest, 
why put them in the constructor?
This allows those values to be changed. Is that the purpose? And if yes, why define them then?

I'm getting an error for the index, but I couldn't figure out what's wrong
